# TinyPaste

TinyPaste is a very simple PasteBin that is super light and can be deployed in minutes on most web servers

TinyPaste uses `PHP` as its backend, pasting process is done using `AJAX` requests, which means it requires JavaScript to be enabled to run.

Thus, if you have a `LAMP` setup, you just need to clone this repository and it will work without any single touch, however, if you use any other web servers such as `nginx`, all you have to do is to install `PHP` and adapt `.htaccess` configurations to whatever configuration your web server relies on.

`.htaccess` files aren't mandatory, but they are **HIGHLY** recommended that you use them (or the your webserver's equivalent), as they ensure the best security and quickest data delivery.
